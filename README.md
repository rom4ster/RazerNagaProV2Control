# RazerNagaV2Control

### Simple app to control keybinds for Razer Naga pro v2 mouse. The goal of this project is the abolishment of razer synapse. It shocked me that openrazer cant do this. 

## BETA, NOT ALL KEYBINDS TESTED

## FEATURES

Can bind to keyboard keys, and include modifiers and can bind to mouse keys as well. Not all possible keys are known (Help wanted). Not all possible binds are known, and some binds may not be correct (Testers/help wanted). 

## LIMITATIONS

Razer has battery levels, macros, and a whole slew of supported options. While you may be able to hack a few of them in, right now only keyboard and mouse binding is supported. I would like to add more so please help/PR

Lighting is out of scope for this project. Use OpenRGB.
