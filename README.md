# RazerNagaV2Control

### Simple app to control keybinds for Razer Naga pro v2 mouse. The goal of this project is the abolishment of razer synapse. It shocked me that openrazer cant do this. 

## BETA, NOT ALL KEYBINDS TESTED

## FEATURES

Can bind to keyboard keys, and include modifiers and can bind to mouse keys as well. Not all possible keys are known (Help wanted). Not all possible binds are known, and some binds may not be correct (Testers/help wanted). 

Can customize which scroll wheel haptic stages are enabled and what order they are in. 

Can use custom stage but setting the values for custom stage is WIP. (HELP NEEDED)

## LIMITATIONS

Razer has battery levels, macros, and a whole slew of supported options. While you may be able to hack a few of them in, right now only keyboard and mouse binding is supported. I would like to add more so please help/PR

Lighting is out of scope for this project. Use OpenRGB. 


## COLLABORATION

Feel free to make an issue, make a PR, or chat on discord https://discord.gg/BRXGMF6geJ

Currently the biggest hurdle is the ability to understand the custom scroll wheel stage values. We need help in figuring out how to tell the mouse the values to use.  

## Captures

If you have capture data for this mouse, PLEASE SHARE. Just make an issue or send on discord. Would love to have help getting all the captures.
